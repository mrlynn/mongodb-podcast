## Show Notes

Meet the team behind the MongoDB Podcast - Nic Raboy and Mike Lynn. In this preview, get to know your co-hosts and hear what's to come from us. 

We're creating this podcast to tell developers, startups, and large organizations stories about what it's like working in tech, what's new and emerging, get you familiar with what MongoDB offers, examples of how people are currently using MongoDB, and to provide overall ideas and knowledge into the NoSQL and MongoDB space.

If there's a subject you'd like to see covered on the show or know a company that should be featured, drop us a suggestion in the [MongoDB Community Forums](https://community.mongodb.com).
